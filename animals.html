              <h3>Platypus</h3>
              <p>
                The ultimate animal mashup! This mammal lays eggs, has a duck
                bill, webbed feet, and produces venom. It's like nature couldn't
                decide what animal to make, so it made all of them at once.

              <h3>Okapi</h3>
              <p>
                Known as the "forest giraffe," this animal looks like a
                zebra-giraffe hybrid. It has zebra stripes on its legs but the
                body of a giraffe. Scientists didn't discover it until 1901!

              <h3>Dumbo Octopus</h3>
              <p>
                Named after Disney's Dumbo, this deep-sea octopus has ear-like
                fins that make it look like it's flying through the water. It
                lives in the darkest depths of the ocean.

              <h3>Frilled Lizard</h3>
              <p>
                This Australian lizard has a massive frill around its neck that
                it opens like an umbrella when threatened. It also runs on its
                hind legs like a tiny dinosaur!

            <div class="feature-card">
              <div class="feature-icon">🐸</div>
              <h3>Glass Frog</h3>
              <p>
                This transparent frog has see-through skin on its belly, so you
                can literally see its heart beating and food digesting! It's
                like a living X-ray machine.

              <h3>Honduran White Bat</h3>
              <p>
                These tiny white bats build tents out of leaves by cutting the
                leaf's central vein, causing it to fold down like a tent.
                They're the only bats known to make their own shelters!

              <h3>Pink Fairy Armadillo</h3>
              <p>
                The world's smallest armadillo, this pink creature is only 4-5
                inches long and lives underground in Argentina. It's so rare
                that scientists rarely see it in the wild.

              <h3>Blobfish</h3>
              <p>
                This deep-sea fish looks like a sad blob when brought to the
                surface due to pressure changes. In its natural deep-sea
                habitat, it looks like a normal fish!

              <h3>Kakapo</h3>
              <p>
                The world's only flightless parrot! This nocturnal bird from New
                Zealand is also the heaviest parrot and can live up to 90 years.
                It's critically endangered with only about 200 left.
