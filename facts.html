              <h3>Honey Never Spoils</h3>
              <p>
                Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian
                tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible.
                Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH make it inhospitable
                to bacteria and microorganisms.

              <h3>Penguins Can Jump 6 Feet</h3>
              <p>
                Emperor penguins can leap out of the water up to 6 feet high!
                This incredible jumping ability helps them escape from predators
                like seals and orcas in the Antarctic waters.

              <h3>Cacti Store Water</h3>
              <p>
                A fully grown saguaro cactus can store up to 200 gallons of
                water! That's enough to fill about 1,500 water bottles. They can
                survive for years without rain by using this stored water.

              <h3>Giraffes Have Blue Tongues</h3>
              <p>
                Giraffes have dark blue tongues that can be up to 20 inches
                long! The blue color comes from melanin, which protects their
                tongues from sunburn while they're eating leaves from tall
                trees.

              <p>
                Around the world, lightning strikes about 8.6 million times per
                day, or about 100 times per second! The most lightning-prone
                place on Earth is Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela.

              <h3>Sharks Lose 30,000 Teeth</h3>
              <p>
                A shark can lose up to 30,000 teeth in its lifetime! They have
                multiple rows of teeth that constantly fall out and are
                replaced. Some sharks can go through 50,000 teeth in their
                lifetime.

              <h3>The Moon Has Moonquakes</h3>
              <p>
                The moon experiences "moonquakes" that can last up to 30
                minutes! These are caused by tidal forces from Earth's gravity
                and can reach up to 5.5 on the Richter scale.

              <h3>Ants Never Sleep</h3>
              <p>
                Ants don't sleep in the traditional sense! Instead, they take
                short power naps throughout the day, totaling about 4-5 hours of
                rest. They don't have eyelids, so they can't close their eyes.

              <h3>Bananas Are Berries</h3>
              <p>
                Botanically speaking, bananas are berries, but strawberries
                aren't! In botanical terms, a berry is a fruit produced from a
                single ovary, which bananas are, but strawberries are "aggregate
                fruits."
