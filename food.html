              <h3>Century Eggs (China)</h3>
              <p>
                These eggs are preserved in a mixture of clay, ash, salt, and
                lime for several weeks to months. The yolk turns dark green and
                the white becomes a dark brown jelly. They're considered a
                delicacy!

              <h3>Casu Marzu (Italy)</h3>
              <p>
                This Sardinian cheese is intentionally infested with live
                maggots! The maggots break down the cheese fats, making it soft
                and creamy. It's illegal in many countries due to health
                concerns.

                Known as the "king of fruits," durian has a strong odor that
